                    Smile for Sache Girls Club is a youth-focused space where girls can show up as
                    themselves, build confidence, and feel supported by mentors who care. We centre
                    community, belonging, and joy in everything we do.

                <p>
                    Through weekly programs, workshops, and special events, we help girls explore who
                    they are, try new things, and develop skills that support them in school, at home,
                    and in the future.

                    The Girls Club was created to carry forward the spirit of Smile for Sache by
                    focusing directly on girls in our community. We saw a need for a space where
                    Black, Muslim, newcomer, and racialized girls could feel seen, supported, and
                    celebrated.

                    Every workshop, game, and conversation is rooted in joy and community care. Our
                    goal is to make sure each girl leaves feeling a little more confident, connected,
                    and hopeful about what’s possible for her future.
