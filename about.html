            The Smile for Sache Girls Club is a program under the non-profit Smile for Sache,
            dedicated to empowering girls ages 11–17 through accessible, holistic, and inclusive
            programming. We create a brave, inspiring environment where girls can explore wellness,
            arts, sport, and community while building confidence and leadership. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

            We also run a mentorship stream for women ages 18–29, giving them hands-on experience in
            community leadership, event planning, and peer support. Together, mentors and youth create
            a cycle of empowerment where young people learn, grow, and give back. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
